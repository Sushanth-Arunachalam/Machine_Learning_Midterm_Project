This repository has been created to store the midterm project code, report and dataset 

Weather Severity Prediction
This project predicts the severity of weather events using historical weather data. The model, built with a RandomForestClassifier (accuracy: 91.42%), helps local government emergency management teams allocate resources and respond to extreme weather conditions. For details on dataset, feature engineering, model evaluation, and deployment via Gradio, please refer to the full documentation in the repository.
